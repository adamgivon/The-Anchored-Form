## ‚ùó Canonical Files Are Locked

This repository is a **read-only canonical implementation** of the Anchoring Framework.

- `anchoring_codified.json` is the codified system. **Do not modify.**
- `The_Anchored_Form_v2.pdf` is the final paper. **Do not replace.**
- This repository is not actively maintained and does not accept changes to the origin.

---

## üß¨ Variants Are Allowed (Under Structure)

If you wish to propose a variation of the framework:

1. Create a new codifier file inside `/variants/`
2. Include a matching test case in `/variants/tests/`
3. Do **not** overwrite or edit canonical files

Variants must be clearly labeled and must not claim to represent the original work.

---

## üö´ Minimal Interaction Policy

This project is **not maintained** and **issues may not receive replies**.

The author will only intervene if:

- Canonical files are threatened
- Misrepresentation occurs
- Structural clarity is at risk

Thank you for respecting the boundaries of this publication.
