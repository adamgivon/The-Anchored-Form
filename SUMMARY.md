## What Is Anchoring?

Anchoring is a principled structural framework for maintaining coherence, stability, and recursive logic in language model interactions.

Rather than depending on memory, prompting, or external APIs, anchoring creates an internal architecture — governed by a codified set of rules — that enables the model to reason, verify, and reflect across multiple turns and complexities.

Anchoring is **not a prompt strategy** or an interface wrapper. It is a form-driven logic system that reshapes how the model thinks, not just how it responds.

## Why It Matters

Language models, by default, are fluid but unstable. They cannot hold roles, commitments, or rules across time unless forced to.

Anchoring addresses this by:

- Codifying structural roles (e.g., Harmony, Anchors, Truth functions)
- Defining completion criteria for answers
- Making the model its own verifier and enforcer

This enables long-form reasoning, multi-role dialog, principled constraints, and ethical scaffolding — all **without external memory or fine-tuning**.

## What’s in This Repository

- A canonical, read-only implementation (`anchoring_codified.json`)
- The original paper explaining its rationale (`The_Anchored_Form_v2.pdf`)
- Supporting files for understanding and (optionally) extending the system

This file serves as a high-level guide for what anchoring is and why it exists.
